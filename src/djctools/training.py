class Trainer:
    """
    Trainer class for multi-GPU training using custom parallel utilities.
    
    This Trainer class handles the initialization, manual batch distribution, 
    and model synchronization across multiple GPUs, allowing flexibility for complex data structures 
    and control over data loading. Compatible with both single and multi-GPU configurations, 
    and can fall back to CPU if no GPU is available or `num_gpus=0` is specified.
    
    Attributes:
        model (torch.nn.Module): The main model for training.
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): The optimizer for updating model parameters.
        num_gpus (int): Number of GPUs to use for training. Set to 0 for CPU training.
        device_ids (list of int): List of GPU device IDs to use for training. Defaults to `[0, 1, ..., num_gpus-1]`.
        device (str): The primary device for training, either a specified GPU or 'cpu'.
        verbose_level (int): Controls verbosity of output, with `> 0` printing batch-wise loss updates.
    
    Methods:
        _data_to_device(data, device):
            Recursively moves data (tensors, lists, dictionaries) to the specified device.
        
        create_batches(data_iterator):
            Manually creates and distributes batches across GPUs or CPU from the provided data iterator.
    
        train_loop(train_loader):
            Executes the training loop over one epoch. Handles forward, backward passes, 
            gradient updates, and logging of training losses.
        
        val_loop(val_loader):
            Executes the validation loop, computing and logging validation losses. Runs without gradient updates.
    
        save_model(filepath):
            Saves the model to a file. 
    
        load_model(filepath):
            Loads model from a file. 

        train_batch_callback(model, batch_number, batch_data):
            Callback function that is called after each batch is processed during training.
            The function should take the model, the batch number, and the batch data as arguments.
            This function can be used to perform custom operations on the model or the data after each batch
            and should be implemented by the user through inheritance. Please do not use for logging purposes,
            use the wandb_wrapper.log() function instead.

        val_batch_callback(model, batch_number, batch_data):
            Callback function that is called after each batch is processed during validation.
            The function should take the model, the batch number, and the batch data as arguments.
            This function can be used to perform custom operations on the model or the data after each batch
            and should be implemented by the user through inheritance. Please do not use for logging purposes,
            use the wandb_wrapper.log() function instead.

    
    Example Usage:
    --------------
    >>> model = MyModel() # The model must use LossModule to define the loss(es)
    >>> optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    >>> trainer = Trainer(model, optimizer, num_gpus=2, verbose_level=1)
    
    >>> for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    >>>     trainer.train_loop(train_loader)
    >>>     trainer.val_loop(val_loader)
    
    >>> trainer.save_model("model_weights.pth")
    
    Notes:
    ------
    - The `Trainer` class assumes single-process execution. Each batch is moved manually to the correct device,
      allowing full control over batch distribution.
    - This class is optimized for cases where each batch may consist of complex nested structures 
      (e.g., lists of dictionaries or tuples). It can be used with both standard PyTorch data loaders 
      and custom data iterators.
